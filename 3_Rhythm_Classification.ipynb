    "# Clustering segments of ECG signals using Wavelet Tranform\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes a clustering of segments of ECG signals into normal and anomolous based on the features extracted after a wavelet transform of the signals is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outline of the approach\n",
    "-  The signals are first preprocessed by applying a low bandpass filter and removing the first and last few segemnts\n",
    "- Wavelet Decomposition of the signal is performed.\n",
    "- The signal is then broken into segments of a fixed length and time domain features are extracted from the signal\n",
    "- DBSCAN is used to cluster each segment and the anomolous segments are labelled on their position in the orignal signal.\n",
    "- The results are computed per patient and stored in anomalies_clustering/Rhythm"
